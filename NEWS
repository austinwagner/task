New Features in Taskwarrior 2.5.0

  - The active context, if one is set, is now identified in "task context list"
  - It is an error to attempt adding or removing a virtual tag.
  - New 'UDA', 'ORPHAN', 'PROJECT', 'PRIORITY' and 'LATEST'  virtual tags.

New Commands in Taskwarrior 2.5.0

  - The '_unique' command shows a set of unique values for the specified
    attribute
  - The 'commands' command shows the supported commands, with additional
    details that determine some of their behavior.

New Configuration Options in Taskwarrior 2.5.0

  - The 'json.depends.array' setting controls whether dependencies are exported
    as a JSON array, of a comma-separated string.  Default is 'on'.
    Both variations are imported.
  - The 'color.uda.<name>.none' is a color that is applied to tasks that do
    not have a value for the UDA '<name>'.
  - A Cygwin fix means that now we can default 'search.case.sensitive' to 'yes',
    and all platforms are again equal.
  - The new 'recur' verbosity token generates a message when a recurring task is
    generated.
  - The new 'unwait' verbosity token generates a message when a waiting task
    becomes visible.
  - The new 'rule.color.merge' configuration option can disable merging of colors
    produced by different color rules. Use if your color scheme produces
    unpleasing foreground and background combinations.

Newly Deprecated Features in Taskwarrior 2.5.0

  - The '_ids', '_projects', '_tags', '_uuids' helper commands are deprecated,
    and replaced by the new '_unique' helper command.
  - Comma-separated ID lists are deprecated.
  - The 'new-uuid' verbosity token is deprecated. Its functionality will
    be merged with the 'new-id' verbosity token.

Removed Features in 2.5.0

  - The script 'context' was removed, now that context is a core feature.
  - NonÂ­extended forms of ISO-8601 date/time support is removed. This means
    that 'YYYYMMDD' is no longer supported, but 'YYYY-MM-DD' is. For times,
    'hhmmss' is no longer supported, but 'hh:mm:ss' is. The non-extended
    forms all contain sequences of digits that make the identification of
    IDs, UUIDs, and various date/time formats ambiguous.
  - Comma-separated UUID lists are no longer supported.
  - DOM references may no longer be abbreviated.
  - The 'urgency.next.coefficient' configuration option is deprecated in favor
    of 'urgency.user.tag.next.coefficient'.
  - The long deprecated syntax of color values with underscores (i.e 'on_red')
    is no longer supported.
